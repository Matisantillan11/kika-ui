Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Chakra UI ðŸ–¤, you rock!

Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

# Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Kika UI:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Matisantillan11/kika-ui))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kika-ui.git
cd kika-ui
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `yarn`. This
   command will install dependencies.

### Commands

**`yarn `**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`yarn dev`**: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that
end with `.stories.tsx`.

**`yarn build`**: run build for all component packages.
